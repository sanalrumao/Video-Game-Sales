** Project Overview**

This project aims to analyze video game sales data to uncover trends, regional preferences, and key factors influencing game sales. Using Python, we perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and predictive modeling to gain insights into the gaming industry.

** Objectives**

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handle missing values, normalize data, and ensure consistency.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify best-selling games, popular platforms, and regional sales trends.

Trend Analysis: Examine sales trends over the years and how different genres perform.

Predictive Modeling: Use regression models to predict sales based on various features.

Data Visualization: Generate graphs and charts for better insights.

**** Tech Stack
